# Multi-Model Management TUI

- Built a TUI for hosting multiple LLMs on the same server
- Easy switching between models without manual restarts
- Efficient resource sharing across different models
- Simplifies experimentation and testing
- Example: Server 2 hosts both gpt-oss-20b and gemma-3-12b-it
