# Not Everything is Perfect

**Challenges:**
- Qwen3-Coder not meeting quality expectations compared to Claude Sonnet 4.5
- Model selection critical for agent task performance
- Need to evaluate alternative models

**But there's a silver lining:**
- Can now host specialized LLMs for semantic search
- No token cost concerns
- Complete privacy control
- Use case-specific models without budget constraints
